Passenger mobility demand model

## Purpose of the model

The model is developed to project mobility demand for South Asian countries. The model can consider various passenger mobility related phenomenon such as urbanisation, transit oriented development and disruptive technologies (autonomous vehicles, Mobility-as-a-service) to generate multiple scenarios. It is a relatively high resolution model that allows generation and visualisation of diverse and detailed passenger mobility futures for South Asian countries. 

## Core model components

- Phenomena are quatified through a comprehensive literature based evidence, prioritising evidence from global South regions.
- Model is developed considering data from South Asia and the latest SSPs. 
- Four alternate passenger mobility scenarios developed 

## Scenario description

- Base: Describes baseline demand projections
- National Policies (NP): Compilation of national policies in South Asian countries
- Best Practices (BP): Successful implmentation of innovative mobility solutions in the Global South
- Transit Oriented Development (TOD): Compact development 
- Technology Focus (TECH): Rapid technological progress
