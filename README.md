# Passenger mobility demand model

## Purpose of the model

The model is developed to project mobility demand for South Asian countries. The model considers various passenger mobility related phenomenon such as urbanisation, transit oriented development and disruptive technologies (autonomous vehicles, Mobility-as-a-service) to generate multiple scenarios. It is a relatively high resolution model that allows generation and visualisation of diverse and detailed passenger mobility futures for South Asian countries. 

## Core model components

- **Phenomena Quantification**: Utilizes comprehensive, literature-based evidence, prioritizing data from Global South regions.
- **Data Sources**: Developed using data from South Asia and the latest Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
- **Scenarios**: Includes four alternate passenger mobility scenarios to explore different futures.

## Scenario description

1. **Base**: Describes baseline demand projections without additional interventions.
2. **National Policies (NP)**: Reflects the compilation of national policies from South Asian countries.
3. **Best Practices (BP)**: Envisions the successful implementation of innovative mobility solutions from the Global South.
4. **Transit Oriented Development (TOD)**: Focuses on compact development and slower urbanization.
5. **Technology Focus (TECH)**: Considers rapid technological advancements and their impacts on mobility.
